## What It Is

Pixer is a dedicated, unofficial Deezer client for Android. It focuses on providing a clean, expressive Material 3 UI for browsing, searching, and streaming music directly from Deezer. 

## Acknowledgements

This project is a fork of [PixelPlayerOSS](https://github.com/lostf1sh/PixelPlayerOSS), originally created by [@lostf1sh](https://github.com/lostf1sh). 

While the original PixelPlayerOSS focused on local playback and self-hosted music libraries, **Pixer** removes all local capabilities to focus entirely on being a streamlined, cloud-first Deezer experience. Huge thanks to the original developer for providing such an incredible foundation and UI!
